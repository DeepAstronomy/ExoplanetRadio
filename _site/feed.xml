&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search for life on other worlds is, to say the least, a daunting and overwhelming task.We’ve been searching for only about one human generation and have yet to find anything in our own solar system, let alone the vast expanse of our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase our chances of finding life on other planets, a systematic approach needs to be adopted, one that applies reasonable assumptions that maximize our success.  So, an important question becomes, where should we point our telescopes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s probably reasonable to assume that simpler, microbial life is more abundant that advanced intelligence with its attendant technology.  On Earth, for example, life emerged within a few hundred million years of the planet’s formation. This suggests that if the right conditions exist on other planets, life could arise there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if life is abundant, it is also old because there have been a lot of planetary systems formed in the history of our galaxy, most of them before our own solar system existed.  Astronomers estimate that within 326 light years of the Sun, there may be as many as 10,000 rocky planets in the habitable zone.  The formation of these planets in the solar neighborhood was likely episodic, coming in fits and starts from as far back as 10 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solar system came about five billion years ago when a satellite galaxy which consists of primarily four globular clusters in its body called the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, went straight into the Milky Way’s stellar disk. Astronomers believe the formation of our own solar system was triggered by the first passing of this galaxy.  It’s happened two more times since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here the stage is set: from about 10 to 5 billion years ago, most of the planets within about 300 light years were formed.  This makes them older than the solar system.  We do not know which fraction of these terrestrial planets were habitable or earth like in order for microbial life to eventually arise there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if microbial life did arise as soon as it did on Earth in greater than, say, one percent of the 10,000 or so terrestrial planets around k-type stars, then astronomers estimate the closest ‘life-harboring Earth-like planet’ would be 65 light years away. And it would have had up to a 10 billion year head start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here, of course, is knowing the frequency with which simple life arises from non-life, and we can only guess at that since we haven’t found any life anywhere else yet.  But assuming that microbial life did arise as fast as it did on Earth and that it eventually arises in all planets that are in the habitable zone, then the closest, life-harboring Earth-like planet could be less than 16 light years away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to test this, is to look for biosignatures within a sphere with a radius of 16 light years.  Something that future surveys, like the Vera Rubin Telescope and the Habitable Worlds Observatory are uniquely capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much we do not know about life on exoplanets, but we are steadily making progress.  If we could just get a handle on how easy or hard it is for life to arise from primordial organic building blocks these estimations would be a lot more accurate.  To do that, we’d need several data points, and right now, we have only one.  Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is hard for life to arise, then we are likely alone, or at best, isolated.  But if it is easy, then life is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">To increase our chances of finding life on other planets, a systematic approach needs to be adopted, one that applies reasonable assumptions that maximize our success.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long before the Earth becomes uninhabitable for all life?  This is a reasonable question to ask in the context of our search for life elsewhere because it gives us a framework within which we might expect to discover life on exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing lasts forever, stars live and die over the course of hundreds of millions to billions, and in the case of red dwarf stars, trillions of years.  Planets are born from the remnants of their parent stars and die over a shorter timescale.  Life on those planets, if it exists, is presumed to be shorter still, governed entirely by the environments provided by the combination of the star and planetary characteristics.  How long life lasts there ultimately depends on how long the star lives and how it dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using our solar system as an example, since we know life arose here, how long will it last?  Astronomers think they have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Sun is a star, and like all stars, it has a lifespan. The Sun is currently in its middle age, but it will eventually get old and die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about 5 billion years, the Sun will run out of hydrogen in its core and will begin to fuse helium into carbon. This process will cause the Sun to expand into a red giant star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Sun expands, it will engulf Mercury and Venus. It may even reach Earth’s orbit, but it is not clear whether it will swallow Earth or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well before the Sun reaches this stage, astronomers believe things will get bad for life, probably billions of years before the Sun even reaches the Red Giant stage.  According to some new modeling done by astronomers, In the later phase of the Sun’s life, over the next couple of billion years or so, the increasing amounts of energy Earth will receive from the aging Sun will warm its atmosphere. The hotter the atmosphere, the more water vapor it will trap as water evaporates from Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sun’s ultraviolet rays will break this water vapor down into oxygen and hydrogen, and hydrogen is a gas light enough to escape the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With water escaping into space, the oceans will dry up and the crust will dry out, leaving a desolate, uninhabitable world.  Life on Earth will end at least a billion years before the Sun expands into a Red Giant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As volcanoes continue throwing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, there will be no oceans to absorb it or life forms to store it. This buildup of carbon dioxide causes what is called a “runaway greenhouse effect,” turning Earth into a hot, dry world like Venus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Venus may have once hosted a shallow liquid-water ocean and temperatures conducive to life before a runaway greenhouse process made its environment unbearable when it was only 2 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of life on other worlds, we need to remember that even though a star might have planets that harbor life, any life that existed there might be long gone even though the star is still relatively young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we have a few billion years before this happens to us. Who knows, humanity might even manage to become a star traveling civilization, capable of stupendous technological marvels that would protect us from a dying sun.  A billion years is a long time for humans, even if it’s a blink of an eye in a star’s lifetime, plenty of time to think and plan and dream.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">Nothing lasts forever, stars live and die over the course of hundreds of millions to billions, and in the case of red dwarf stars, trillions of years.

	&lt;h2&gt; Exoplanet HAT-P-11 b&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;500px&quot; id=&quot;exo_pioneer_module&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/exo/#/planet/HAT-P-11_b&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this show, we’ve talked many many times about the Transit Method for detecting exoplanets.  It is simply the measure of a star’s decrease in brightness as the star passes through our line of sight.  This once difficult measurement has now become commonplace and can even be done with advanced amateur astronomy equipment under a reasonably dark sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this measurement, we can infer a few things about the planets passing by: we can get an indication of its size and if we measure several transits, we can get the period of the orbit around the host star.  We can also get an estimate of the period and eccentricity of the orbit by the width of the dip in the light curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is another, even more difficult measurement we can make using transit telescopes that are an important tool for learning about planets around other stars: exoplanet secondary eclipses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To visualize a secondary eclipse is tricky.  When the planet passes in front of the star and blocks some of its light, we have a transit, or primary eclipse, that part isn’t so hard to visualize and this measurement is much easier to make.  But now imagine that as the planet travels in its orbit around the star the reflected light from the planet starts to add brightness to our observations that gets ever so slightly brighter as it travels around towards the back of the star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planet’s reflected light is at its brightest just as it begins to pass behind the star and the moment it begins to go behind it, the reflected light diminishes and shows up as a secondary dimming in the measurement from the telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, this is a very difficult measurement to make and it requires extreme precision from the telescope, extraordinary detector sensitivity, and very careful calibration and processing of the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the secondary eclipse, astronomers get information about the thermal structure of the atmosphere of the exoplanet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, in 2016 astronomers used the extensive Kepler data from the exoplanet HAT-P-11b - a Neptune like planet that orbits its star once every five days.  The data  spanned over five years of looking at the same spot in the sky.  Carefully analyzing these observations revealed a secondary eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this tiny signal, astronomers inferred that the temperature of the planet varied a lot as it went around the sun; it had a highly eccentric orbit.  They deduced this because there were large temperature variations from the highly varied star-to-planet distances in the orbit.  The variations changed according to where in the orbit the planet was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that HAT-P-11b was hot, with a boiling sky.  The atmospheric temperature ranged from 300 Celsius to over 600 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exoplanet secondary eclipses are brightest in the infrared and while astronomers have been able to tease out secondary eclipses from data archives of the Kepler and TESS Space Telescopes, with the deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope, which is specifically designed to look in the infrared, astronomers should begin to get more characteristics from explanets from their secondary eclipses.  Learning more about exoplanetary atmospheres from planets around the galaxy will fill in many blanks from these exotic worlds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">Over the course of this show, we’ve talked many many times about the Transit Method for detecting exoplanets.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet TOI-1853 b, one of the weirdest exoplanets ever discovered! It’s about the size of Neptune, but four times more massive. It orbits its star so closely that it completes a full orbit in just 1.24 days. This makes it very hot, and it’s located in a region of space known as the “hot Neptune desert,” where astronomers have been looking for Hot Neptunes but unable to find any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on the one hand, this is great:  we have a Neptune sized planet close to its star where we haven’t seen many.  On the other hand, this is a really strange world.  It’s the size of Neptune sure, but four times more massive than Neptune and about 73 times more massive than Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers infer the mass by looking at the wobble of the host star as the planet orbits it.  They get the size by looking at how much the host star’s light dimmed as it passed in front of it, they can also get the orbital period by looking at the dips several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we have a huge and massive planet close to its star.  How did it get there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are baffled by TOI-1853 b. They’re not sure how it formed, or why it’s so massive. One possibility is that it started out as a gas giant, but lost its atmosphere due to the intense radiation from its star. Another possibility is that it formed in a much cooler region of space, and then migrated closer to its star later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are planets this size all over the place, but not this massive.  One way astronomers infer whether a planet is rocky or not is by it size.  It’s assumed that larger planets are gas giants and one reason we don’t see Hot Neptunes that much is their atmospheres get stripped away.  So if that happened in this case, what could account for the mass involved here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planet’s mass is too large to have formed from the accumulation of small dust particles from the planet-forming disk. It is also unlikely that the planet formed in its current location, as solids have difficulty condensing there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So astronomers tell us we are left with two rather strange possibilities: either TOI-1853 b is a rocky planet with a thin atmosphere: This is the most likely scenario, as it is consistent with the planet’s density. The atmosphere would be so thin that it would account for only one percent of the planet’s mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is its got a rocky core with a thick layer of water: This is less likely, but possible. The water would be in a supercritical state, meaning that it would be both a liquid and a gas. The pressure near the rocky core would force the water to form high-pressure solids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever its origins, TOI-1853 b is a fascinating planet and probably not a very habitable one.  Life here would be bone-crushingly hot.  Imagine weighing 73 times more than you do now and living right next door to the star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of exoplanets is a journey of discovery, and we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible. Every new planet we find challenges our understanding of how planets form, where they came from, and what they are like.  We have already learned so much about exoplanets in a short period of time. We have discovered planets of all sizes and shapes, orbiting stars of all types. We have found planets made of gas, rock, and even water. We have even found planets that could potentially be habitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this progress, we are still surprised by what we find.  There is so much more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">Meet TOI-1853 b, one of the weirdest exoplanets ever discovered!

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, scientists have made great strides in the search for extraterrestrial life. They have discovered thousands of exoplanets. And some of them are located in the habitable zone of their star, which means that liquid water could exist on their surface and is essential for life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search for life however, is a little more involved than finding planets, measuring their location and distance around the star and figuring out their location within a habitable zone.  Astronomers need more information to learn if life may be there.  The first thing we need to know is whether or not the planet has an atmosphere and thanks to the Webb Space Telescope, we are starting to get a handle on that data point with every observation it makes using its onboard Near Infrared Spectrometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once astronomers detect an atmosphere, the real fun begins: finding biosignatures.  Biosignatures are indicators of the presence of life, traces left behind by living organisms.  These indicators can be chemical, biological or physical.  An example of a physical biosignature would be things like fossils, and since that requires that we have a physical presence on the planet (we can’t see those from here, not even with JWST), then  we are left with chemical and biological indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best examples of biosignatures that we can detect from so far away are atmospheric gasses and organic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain gases, such as oxygen and methane, can be produced by biological processes. However, they can also be produced by non-biological means. For example, oxygen can be produced by photosynthesis, but it can also be produced by geological activity. The presence of atmospheric gases in a planet’s atmosphere could be a sign of life, but it is important to consider other evidence as well, like organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organic molecules are the building blocks of life. They include amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Organic molecules can be detected in the atmospheres of exoplanets using a technique called spectroscopy. Spectroscopy involves splitting light into its component wavelengths. Organic molecules absorb light at specific wavelengths, so by looking for dips in the spectrum of an exoplanet, scientists can identify the presence of organic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JWST is currently the only instrument we have that can detect biosignatures in this way, it looks at absorbed starlight that has passed through the exoplanet’s atmosphere to see what elements were absorbed.  Just recently, it reported the possibility of the organic molecule dimethyl sulfide in the planet K2-18b, a compound that on Earth is produced primarily by phytoplankton, which are microscopic organisms that live in the ocean. DMS can also be produced by some other biological processes, but it is not known to be produced by anything other than life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMS is a gas, so it can be detected in the atmospheres of exoplanets using spectroscopy. It is also relatively stable in the atmosphere, so it can accumulate to detectable levels.  All of this makes dimethyl sulfide an ideal biosignature gas.  Other biosignatures that are similar to dimethyl sulfide include: Methanethiol, Dimethyl disulfide, Carbon disulfide and Hydrogen cyanide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the detection of a single biosignature is not definitive evidence of life. However, the presence of multiple biosignatures in the same place would be very strong evidence. Additionally, if a biosignature is detected in a place where it is unlikely to be produced by non-biological processes, such as in a Martian meteorite, then it is more likely to be a sign of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope and the future Habitable Worlds Observatory are two powerful tools that we have at our disposal to search for life on other planets. Imagine the day when we discover signs of life beyond Earth. It would be a watershed moment in human history, one that would change our understanding of our place in the universe forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">In recent years, scientists have made great strides in the search for extraterrestrial life.

&lt;p&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope has completed observations of an exoplanet that may contain an ocean-covered surface underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. This discovery provides a fascinating glimpse into a planet unlike anything in our Solar System, and raises interesting prospects about potentially habitable worlds elsewhere in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exoplanet is called K2-18 b, and it’s located about 120 light-years away from us in the constellation Leo. It is bigger than Earth, but not as big as Neptune, putting this exoplanet in a class called sub-Neptunes, one of the most common types of exoplanets we’ve found. It orbits a cool dwarf star called K2-18 in the habitable zone, which means it could have liquid water on its surface. But what’s really amazing is that Webb has detected &lt;strong&gt;methane&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/strong&gt; in its atmosphere. These are carbon-bearing molecules that could indicate the presence of life, or at least some interesting chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webb used its Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument to analyze the light coming from K2-18 b as it passed in front of its star. By looking at how the starlight changed as it filtered through the planet’s atmosphere, Webb could measure the amounts of different molecules in the air. This technique is called &lt;strong&gt;transit spectroscopy&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s one of the best ways to study exoplanet atmospheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results showed that K2-18 b has a hydrogen-rich atmosphere with traces of methane and carbon dioxide. There was also a possible detection of another molecule called &lt;strong&gt;dimethyl sulfide&lt;/strong&gt; (DMS), which on Earth is only produced by living organisms. DMS is emitted by phytoplankton in the oceans, and it helps form clouds and regulate the climate. Could K2-18 b have some kind of ocean life that produces DMS? Or is there another explanation for this mysterious molecule?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18 b’s atmosphere is consistent with the idea that this planet could be a &lt;strong&gt;Hycean&lt;/strong&gt; world. Hycean worlds are a class of exoplanets that have hydrogen-rich atmospheres and water-covered surfaces. They are different from Earth-like worlds, which have nitrogen-rich atmospheres and rocky surfaces. Hycean worlds could be promising targets for finding signs of life but we shouldn’t get too excited just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While K2-18 b lies in the habitable zone, and is now known to harbor carbon-bearing molecules, this does not necessarily mean that the planet can support life. The planet’s large size — with a radius 2.6 times the radius of Earth, and almost 9 times its mass — means that the planet’s interior likely contains a large mantle of high-pressure ice, like Neptune, but with a thinner hydrogen-rich atmosphere and an ocean surface. Hycean worlds are predicted to have oceans of water. However, it is also possible that the ocean is too hot to be habitable or even be in liquid state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are still many uncertainties and challenges in studying K2-18 b. Webb’s observations are only the first step in exploring this fascinating world, and more data and analysis are needed to confirm and refine the results. Astronomers are planning followup studies using the Mid-Infrared Instrument spectrograph on JWST that they hope will further validate their findings and provide new insights into the environmental conditions on K2-18 b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These exciting results are the product of just two observations, and there are many more on the way.  We will use the most advanced observatories on Earth and in space to study this planet in more detail. Our ultimate goal is to find an exoplanet with life on it.  If such a world exists, and we can find it, we will have left the cosmic shores of our home and waded just a bit deeper into the universal ocean and found that we are not alone.  And maybe, just maybe, we learn that the universe is teeming with life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">The James Webb Space Telescope has completed observations of an exoplanet that may contain an ocean-covered surface underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

	&lt;h2&gt; Exoplanet HD 209458 b &apos;Osiris&apos;&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;500px&quot; id=&quot;exo_pioneer_module&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/exo/#/planet/HD_209458_b&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 9, 1999, a team of astronomers from the High Altitude Observatory made a groundbreaking discovery. Using the radial velocity method, they detected a massive, Jupiter-sized planet orbiting a Sun-like star HD 209458. This was the first exoplanet to be discovered using this method, and since that fateful day, this system has become a champion of firsts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planet is HD 209458 b, and nicknamed “Osiris” after the Egyptian god of the underworld. Osiris is a fitting nickname for this planet, as it is a very hot and hostile world. HD 209458 b orbits its star very closely, and its surface temperature is estimated to be around 1,000 degrees Celsius. This makes it too hot for liquid water to exist on its surface, and it is unlikely to be habitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, this planet is remarkable in many ways.  It occupies first place in a long list of discovery milestones.  Here are the areas Osiris occupies first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one of the first exoplanets to be discovered using the transit method, which means that astronomers were able to detect it by observing how its star’s light dimmed as the planet passed in front of it. This was a major breakthrough, as it showed that it was possible to directly detect exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, seeing its transit makes it the first exoplanet to be detected by more than one method: both transit and radial velocity.  Further, it was the first planet to have its orbital speed measured, allowing astronomers to determine its mass directly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Osiris is also the first exoplanet to have its atmosphere directly detected. In 2001, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope were able to measure the absorption of light from HD 209458 b’s atmosphere. This allowed them to identify the presence of sodium and other elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in 2007, astronomers from Lowell Observatory found evidence of water vapor in the upper atmosphere.  Another first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These observations were a major breakthrough in exoplanetary research. It showed that it was possible to learn more about the composition of exoplanet atmospheres, and to search for biosignatures, which are molecules that could be indicative of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Osiris is also the first exoplanet to be observed losing its atmosphere. Astronomers have detected a large plume of hydrogen gas escaping from the planet. This is likely due to the intense heat and stellar winds from the star, stripping it away, leaving a stream of material behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the evaporating atmosphere showed that some exoplanets could actually lose their atmospheres, and that this could have a significant impact on their habitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exoplanet, some 157 light years away,  has single handedly had a profound impact on our understanding of exoplanets and the search for life beyond Earth. It has advanced our understanding of other worlds outside our solar system perhaps more than any other exoplanet we’ve seen.  It has shown that it is possible to directly detect exoplanets and their atmospheres, find out what they are made of  and that some exoplanets are  losing their atmospheres. This information is essential for our understanding of the diversity of exoplanets and the processes that can affect their habitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of HD 209458 b was a major inspiration for the search for life beyond Earth.  Astronomers now realized what was possible when studying other worlds in the distant galaxy.  Although Osiris is not a good candidate for life, its discovery showed that there may be many other exoplanets out there that are more habitable. The detection of water vapor in HD 209458 b’s atmosphere is a promising sign for the search for life beyond Earth, as water is essential for life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">On September 9, 1999, a team of astronomers from the High Altitude Observatory made a groundbreaking discovery.

&lt;p&gt;Deep in the cosmos, NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered four new worlds orbiting a pair of young stars. These planets are providing scientists with a glimpse into a little-understood stage of planetary evolution - the time when atmospheres are being formed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stars TESS looked at are TOI 2076 and TOI 1807 and reside over 130 light-years away with some 30 light-years between them and are located in the northern constellations of Boötes and Canes Venatici. Both are K-type stars, dwarf stars more orange than our Sun, and around 200 million years old, or less than 5% of the Sun’s age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, using data from ESA’s Gaia satellite, scientists showed that the stars are traveling through space in the same direction leading them to think they are related, born from the same cloud of gas..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stars are hyperactive, experiencing stellar flares much more energetic and frequent than those produced by our own Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around TOI 2076, astronomers discovered three mini-Neptunes, worlds between the diameters of Earth and Neptune&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The innermost planet, TOI 2076 b, circles its star once in only 10 days. The outer planets, c and d, have orbits exceeding 17 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOI 1807 hosts only one known planet, TOI 1807 b and is the most extreme of the bunch. It orbits its star in an astonishingly fast 13 hours, making it one of the youngest ultra-short period planets ever discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theories suggest that planets initially have thick atmospheres left over from their formation. But stellar radiation can erode these atmospheres, leaving behind rocky cores. Some planets may then develop secondary atmospheres through planetary processes like volcanic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ages of the TOI 2076 and TOI 1807 systems suggest that their planets may be somewhere in the middle of this atmospheric evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these planets are bombarded with UV radiation, making life here unlikely at this stage in their development.  TOI 2076 b receives 400 times more UV light from its star than Earth does from the Sun – and TOI 1807 b gets around 22,000 times more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are currently working to measure the planets’ masses, but the interference from their hyperactive stars could make this challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If scientists can discover the planets’ masses, that will help NASA’s James Webb space telescope determine if they have atmospheres and study them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discovery is a tantalizing glimpse into the early stages of planetary evolution. By studying these worlds, scientists can learn more about how planets form and how their atmospheres develop.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">Deep in the cosmos, NASA&apos;s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered four new worlds orbiting a pair of young stars.

&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1e is a rocky, close-to-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone around the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 approximately 40 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the fourth of seven planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, which is the most studied planetary system outside our own.  Astronomers are intensely interested in these planets because all seven of them are roughly Earth-sized and rocky, and three of them – including TRAPPIST-1e – are located in the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist on their surfaces. it has a mass about half that of the Earths and it’s about the same size.  All of these planets orbit close to the star. It takes only 6 days for this one to complete one orbit, and is so close that it’s about 30 times closer than Earth is to the Sun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1e was discovered in 2017 based on observations from various telescopes, including NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope, which detected the periodic dimming of light from the star as the planet transits, or passes in front of it. Since then, it has been studied by other telescopes, including NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, which is beginning to probe the  atmosphere and surface conditions of all the planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1e is a fascinating example of how diverse and complex exoplanets can be, and of all the planets in this system, it may be the most suitable exoplanet found yet for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is found to have an atmosphere, which would be a huge deal in and of itself and something the Webb Space Telescope is uniquely equipped to do, then by studying it, we can learn more about its climate and potential for habitability. For example, a detailed study by Webb could detect signs of water vapor and ozone in the planet’s atmosphere, which could provide a protective layer against harmful radiation from the star. Webb could also measure the planet’s dayside temperature to give an indication of just what sort of organisms, if any, could survive there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running models of rocky planets like this suggests that TRAPPIST-1e may not be uniformly hot. Because it is tidally locked to its star, meaning it always shows the same face to it, one side of the planet may be much hotter than the other. The night side may be cold enough to freeze water, creating a stark contrast between day and night. The planet may also have strong winds that circulate heat around the globe, creating a more moderate climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, astronomers are starting to think that life on tidally locked planets might even be found nestled in Terminator Zones, the region where the night side of the planet is separated from the day side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1e is an enormously promising target for future observations with Webb, not only to further understand the physical characteristics of the planet, but Webb has instruments on board which may be able to detect signs of life if they exist. Astronomers call these biosignatures, and are compounds in the atmosphere that could only be put there by living organisms, such as certain types of methane or oxygen.  This would indicate biological activity on the planet’s surface or subsurface.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">TRAPPIST-1e is a rocky, close-to-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone around the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 approximately 40 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/TRAPPIST-1d_Surface.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/TRAPPIST-1d_Surface.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Tidally Locked Worlds: Life in the Twilight Zone</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/science/exoplanet-terminator-zones/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tidally Locked Worlds: Life in the Twilight Zone" /><published>2023-09-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-09-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/science/exoplanet-terminator-zones</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/science/exoplanet-terminator-zones/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our experience here on Earth, we know life here to be tenacious and ubiquitous.  Even in the harshest climates, if we look hard enough, we can usually find some sort of life there.  We are hoping the same is true on worlds around other stars, and recent research has begun looking into the question of whether life on other worlds could exist in the most inhospitable environs: the terminator zone of tidally locked planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All planets that orbit a star have a terminator zone.  This is the band of shadow that marks the night side of a planet and the day side.  On most planets, the terminator moves along the surface as it rotates, but one a tidally locked planet, the terminator stays over the same spot all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tidal locking is a phenomenon that occurs when a planet rotates at the same speed as it orbits its star, so it always shows the same face to it. This happens when the gravitational pull of the star is stronger than the rotational force of the planet, and it causes the planet to slow down until it reaches a stable state. You might be familiar with this effect from our own moon, which is tidally locked to Earth and always shows us the same side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if a planet is tidally locked to its star? Well, that would create a huge contrast in temperatures between the two sides of the planet. The day side would be constantly exposed to the star’s heat and light, while the night side would be in perpetual darkness and cold. Depending on how close the planet is to its star, the day side could be hot enough to melt rocks, while the night side could be cold enough to freeze water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a region in between, called the terminator zone, where things get more interesting. The terminator zone is a band that separates the day from the night, where the temperatures are more moderate and could allow liquid water to exist. And where there is water, there could be life, right? Well, maybe. It depends on a lot of factors, such as the type and size of the star, the amount of water on the planet, and the presence of an atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some scientists have been studying these terminator zones on exoplanets, especially those that orbit dim red dwarf stars, which are very common in our galaxy. Red dwarf stars are smaller and cooler than our sun, but they can still emit powerful flares and radiation that could harm life on nearby planets. However, some of these planets could have habitable climates in their terminator zones, if they have enough water but not too much, and if they have rocky surfaces instead of global oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does water and surface matter? Well, water is essential for life as we know it, but too much water could create a runaway greenhouse effect that would make the planet too hot for life. On the other hand, too little water could make the planet too dry and barren for life. A rocky surface could help regulate the temperature and provide nutrients for life, while an ocean-covered surface could make the planet more uniform and boring for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is an interesting idea, there are still a lot of unknowns and challenges for life to survive on these extreme worlds. For example, how would life cope with the constant light or darkness? How would it deal with the strong winds and storms that could occur in the terminator zone? How would it adapt to the possible volcanic activity on the day side or the ice formation on the night side? How would it communicate and evolve in such diverse environments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the questions that astronomers hope to answer in the future, as they search for signs of life on these exotic planets.  Using telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope and the future Habitable Worlds Telescope, maybe one day we will find out that we are not alone in this vast universe, and that life can thrive in places we never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">Based on our experience here on Earth, we know life here to be tenacious and ubiquitous. Even in the harshest climates, if we look hard enough, we can usually find some sort of life there. We are hoping the same is true on worlds around other stars, and recent research has begun looking into the question of whether life on other worlds could exist in the most inhospitable environs: the terminator zone of tidally locked planets.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/TerminatorZoneExoplanet" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/TerminatorZoneExoplanet" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
