&lt;p&gt;Imagine a planet that is so far away from us that it takes 40 years for its light to reach us. Now imagine that this planet has not one, but two stars that it orbits around. And finally, imagine that this planet has clouds made of sand particles that change the brightness of its atmosphere wildly as they move in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This planet, VHS 1256 b, has recently been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope  and it is a very interesting world. It is not like any of the planets in our solar system, or even like most of the planets that we have found outside our solar system. It is a type of planet called a brown dwarf, which is somewhere between a giant gas planet and a small star. Brown dwarfs are very hard to study, because they are very faint and cold compared to stars, and very bright and hot compared to planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But VHS 1256 b is different from other brown dwarfs, because it has some features that make it easier to observe. First of all, it is very young, only 150 million years old, which is much younger than our sun, at 4.6 billion years old. This means that it is still hot and glowing from its formation, and has not cooled down yet, making it very bright in the infrared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is very far away from its two stars, about four times farther than Pluto is from our sun. This means that it does not get much light or heat from its host stars, and also that its light does not get mixed with the light from its stars when we look at it from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, it has a very fast rotation, spinning around once every 22 hours. This means that its atmosphere is constantly changing and moving, creating different patterns and colors on its surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features make VHS 1256 b a perfect target for the James Webb Space Telescope. JWST is the most powerful and advanced telescope ever built, and it can see things that no other telescope can see. It can see infrared light, which is invisible to our eyes, but which reveals a lot of information about the temperature, composition, and structure of objects in space. It can also see very faint and distant objects, like VHS 1256 b, with great clarity and detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Webb, scientists have been able to see some amazing things about VHS 1256 b’s atmosphere. They have found that it has clouds made of silicate dust, which are tiny particles of rocks like quartz or sand. These clouds are very high in the air, where the temperature is about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (830 degrees Celsius), which is way hotter than an oven. The clouds have different sizes of dust grains, some as small as smoke and some as large as sand. The size of the dust grains affects how they reflect and scatter light, creating different colors and brightness levels on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webb has also been able to see what gasses are in VHS 1256 b’s air. It has found water, methane, carbon monoxide, and maybe carbon dioxide. This is the first time that so many gases are found on a brown dwarf or a planet outside our solar system. These gasses tell us about the chemistry and history of the planet, and how it formed and evolved over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VHS 1256 b is a fascinating example of how diverse and complex the universe is. It shows us that there are many types of planets out there that we have not seen before, and that we can learn a lot from them using new technologies like Webb. It also challenges us to think about what makes a planet a planet, and what makes life possible on a planet. VHS 1256 b may not be habitable for us or any other life forms that we know of, but it may have some secrets or surprises that we have not discovered yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">VHS 1256 b is a fascinating example of how diverse and complex the universe is.

&lt;p&gt;There might be many places in the universe where habitable conditions can exist.  But just having those conditions isn’t enough, in order for life to thrive, it also needs stability.  It took life on Earth about a billion years to appear, but to last, it also needed a cradle that was safe and stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Habitability and stability don’t necessarily need to come from a nearby star.  It could be sufficient to have an atmosphere, some water and a source of heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our galaxy, there are many planets that wander alone in the dark, without a star to orbit. These rogue planets could have formed from the same material that makes stars, or they could have been kicked out of their original star systems by gravitational interactions. Some of these rogue planets could have moons which remain in tow, and these moons could be more than just cold and barren rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a moon has a thick atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, and some water, it could create a greenhouse effect that traps heat and keeps the surface warm. The heat could also come from the tidal forces of the planet, which stretch and squeeze the moon as it orbits around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same process is going on in Saturn’s moon Enceladus and Jupiter’s moon Europa.  A sufficiently thick, heat-trapping atmosphere, might keep the surface warm enough for water to remain liquid.  That water could come from chemical reactions with the carbon dioxide and hydrogen in the atmosphere, initiated by changed particles from space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how long can such a moon sustain life? The tidal forces that heat up the moon also make its orbit more circular over time, which reduces the friction and the heat. Eventually, the moon will cool down and freeze over. The question is: will life have enough time to emerge and evolve before that happens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our own planet’s history, life took about a billion years to appear on Earth. Can a moon of a rogue planet last that long? Astronomers are starting to believe the answer depends on how thick the atmosphere is. A thicker atmosphere means more heat retention and more stability. A thin atmosphere means more heat loss and more variability. According to computer simulations, a moon with a thick atmosphere could stay warm for anywhere from 300 million to almost 2 billion years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s enough time for life to have a chance to arise and hopefully thrive on a moon of a rogue planet. However, before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let’s remember that warmth and water might not be enough to let living organisms appear. There are many factors that influence the origin and evolution of life, and we don’t fully understand them yet.  But it’s probably safe to say that moons of free-floating planets will not be the most favorable places for life to arise.  Stars, because they are so powerful and long lived, are still the best nurseries for any nascent life on an exoplanet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there are many environments in our universe which are very different from what we have here on Earth.  It is important that we investigate them all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">If a moon has a thick atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, and some water, it could create a greenhouse effect that traps heat and keeps the surface warm.

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the course of this podcast, we’ve established the idea that there are a lot of exoplanets in our universe.  Some are big, some are small, some are close to their stars, others are very far away.  One thing we haven’t said much about though is just how far away they all are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people feel that it’s very important for humanity’s long term survival that we become a multiplanet species.  Traveling to and possibly even inhabiting other planets in our solar system is not only possible with our current levels of technology, but compared to going to the stars, it’s downright easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about traveling to exoplanets?  Can we reach the stars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the way things are now with our rocket technology, it’s not looking good.  Let’s use traveling to the closest exoplanet to us as an example.  How long would it take to get to Proxima Centaui b?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get anywhere in the galaxy at anything resembling a reasonable time, we need to go fast - some fraction of light speed would be best.  Proxima Centauri is 4.3 light years away, so even the fastest thing we know about - light - takes years to get there.  So far, the fastest spaceship we have ever built is the New Horizons Probe and it’s going along at 58,000 kilometers per hour. At that speed, it would take roughly 80,000 years to get to Proxima Centauri b.  The Voyager 1 and II probes are also going fast, they aren’t heading toward Proxima b, but they are going really fast too, 61,000 and 55,000 kilometers per hour respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if they were pointed at Proxima b, then we’re looking at about 80,000 years for the Voyager probes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the Parker Solar Probe managed speeds of 700,000 kilometers per hour at closest approach around the Sun, but it did that at very short intervals.  Still that’s .06% the speed of light, so we’re getting there, but it wasn’t sustainable for long distance stellar flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll need to do a lot better than that if we want to get to the closest exoplanet to us in any reasonable amount of time.  Chemical rockets, the kind we’re using right now, won’t get anywhere near fast enough and are very problematic because we need to carry all that fuel with us as we go, and that reduces efficiency a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusion rockets are very promising, but we don’t have any of those yet.  Still, if we could use the energy of fusing Helium-3 isotopes and Deuterium we might be able to reach sustained speeds on order of the Parker Solar Probe of 0.06% the speed of light and arrive at Proxima b in about 25,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sweet spot would be if we could somehow attain speeds of about 10% the speed of light.  If we could do that, then travel to Proxima b, 4.3 light years away would take 44 years or so.  That’s well within a normal human lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly less appealing but still remarkable would be if humanity could achieve 1% light speed.  It would still take 436 years to reach our closest exoplanet, but one can imagine technologies, like cryogenics, that might help us get through the journey intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is big, there’s no doubt about it.  And looking at the big picture, that’s probably a good thing.  Still, it would be nice if we could figure out technologies that can get us to appreciable percentages of light speed to cover these vast interstellar distances in reasonable times.  Of course, we might discover new physics that allows us to traverse the galaxy, but for now we are confined by relativity and technologies that keep us well below light speeds and the distant exoplanets out of our reach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">We’ll need to do a lot better than that if we want to get to the closest exoplanet to us in any reasonable amount of time.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Giant Planet Found Orbiting a Small Star</title><link href="https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/giant-planet-around-small-star/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Giant Planet Found Orbiting a Small Star" /><published>2023-08-08T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/giant-planet-around-small-star</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/giant-planet-around-small-star/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A massive, Jupiter-sized exoplanet has been discovered orbiting a small, low-mass star and this discovery is challenging theories on how planets form around their stars. The planet, called TOI-4860 b, is about the same size as Jupiter and orbits its star once every 1.5 Earth days, classifying it as a warm Jupiter. This is unusual because planets this large are not supposed to form around low-mass stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exoplanet orbits the red dwarf star TOI-4860. Located in the constellation of Corvus the crow some 261 light years away, TOI-4860 has a mass equivalent to just around a third of our Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this large, the team that discovered TOI-4860 b believes that the planet may have formed from a disk of material that was enriched in heavy elements. This enrichment could have helped the planet to grow to its current size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of TOI-4860 b challenges our understanding of how planets form. The traditional model of planet formation says that planets form from disks of gas and dust that surround young stars. The amount of material in these disks is thought to be related to the mass of the star. So, a low-mass star would have a less massive disk, and therefore would not be able to form a planet as large as TOI-4860 b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, astronomers believe that there may be another way for planets to form around low-mass stars. These planets may have formed from the merger of smaller planets. This would require a very specific set of circumstances, but it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOI-4860 b was first spotted by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which hunts planets outside the solar system by looking for tiny drops in the brightness of light emitted by stars. Those dimmings are caused as an orbiting planet crosses between the host star and our telesocpes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of TOI-4860 b is a reminder that we still have a lot to learn about how planets form. This discovery is just one more piece of the puzzle, and it will be exciting to see what else we learn in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding planets in locations we don’t expect and in regions that defy our current understanding is an important reason why astronomers scan the heavens in search of other worlds.  The universe is a vast and mysterious place and we have only just begun the quest for life in the universe and it all starts with these observations, performed by vigilant ground and space-based telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">Finding planets in locations we don’t expect and in regions that defy our current understanding is an important reason why astronomers scan the heavens in search of other worlds</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First Exoplanets: The Discovery That Forever Changed Us</title><link href="https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/the-first-exoplanets/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First Exoplanets: The Discovery That Forever Changed Us" /><published>2023-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/the-first-exoplanets</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/the-first-exoplanets/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our galaxy likely holds hundreds of billions of planets around other stars but when and how did we begin finding them?  What was the first exoplanet detected?  It turns out that the first discovery wasn’t one, but two planets in the same system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steady drumbeat of exoplanet discovery began in 1992 when astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail found two rocky planets orbiting a type of neutron star known as a pulsar, a rapidly spinning stellar corpse that pulses with millisecond bursts of searing radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring slight changes in the timing of the pulses is what allowed scientists to reveal the two rocky planets in orbit around the pulsar.The planets were named Poltergeist and Phobetor, and they were about the size of Earth and Neptune, respectively. They orbited the pulsar at distances of about where the asteroid belt and Uranus is in our solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These first two planets found by humans on Earth are not habitable. They are too close to the pulsar, and are constantly bombarded by radiation. However, their discovery showed that planets can exist around other stars, and it opened up the possibility that there may be habitable planets out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding these planets around this spinning star essentially opened the floodgates, and hinted that there must be planets everywhere because if we can find planets around a neutron star, which is a very harsh environment, then the planet production process must be very robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit later astronomers started looking for planets like ours and the first planet detected around a Sun-like star was in 1995, and turned out to be a hot Jupiter: a gas giant about half the mass of our own Jupiter in an extremely close, four-day orbit around its star. A year on this planet, in other words, lasts only four days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these exciting beginnings, over 5,000 exoplanets have since been discovered and some of them are located in the habitable zone of their stars, which is the region around a star where liquid water could exist on the surface of a planet. Some of these planets are even Earth-sized, which makes them even more likely to be habitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of exoplanets has opened up a new chapter in our understanding of the universe. We now know that planets are not just a unique feature of our own solar system, but are common throughout the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are on the cusp of a new era of discovery, and the possibilities are endless. We are on a quest that will hopefully answer some of the most fundamental questions about our place in the universe, and that could also change the course of human history.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">The observations of planets around other stars is very recent and it changed our view of humanity&apos;s place in the universe forever.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Finding Exoplanets</title><link href="https://exoplanetradio.com/science/finding-exoplanets/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Finding Exoplanets" /><published>2023-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://exoplanetradio.com/science/finding-exoplanets</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://exoplanetradio.com/science/finding-exoplanets/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are a species of wonder. We have always looked up at the stars and wondered if we are alone in the universe. Are there other worlds out there, with other beings who look up at the stars and wonder about us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search for exoplanets is our best chance of finding out. Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars other than the Sun. They are incredibly faint compared to their parent stars, but scientists have come up with some clever methods to find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way is to measure the radial velocity of a star. This is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. If a planet is orbiting the star, the gravitational pull of the planet will cause the star to wobble a little bit as it goes around. This wobble can be detected by looking at the movement of the spectrum of the star, measuring the star’s radial velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to find exoplanets is to look for transits. This is when a planet passes in front of its star, blocking out a little bit of the star’s light.  As the planet passes in front a tiny dip in brightness of the star is measured by very sensitive telescopes.  The amount of light blocked by the star gives us important information, such as the size of the planet, it’s distance from the star as well as the length of time to complete one orbit around the star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, it has become possible to use direct imaging to find exoplanets. This requires some of the best telescopes ever built and very sophisticated processing techniques, but optics, detectors and computer software have become so good that we can actually see the planets themselves. This is the most difficult method of finding exoplanets, but it’s the only way to see what they actually look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microlensing is also used by astronomers to look for the temporary brightening of a star caused by the gravitational lensing of a passing planet.  As a relatively dark planet passes in front of a star, its gravitational field causes the star to brighten as the light passes by. This brightening is very small, but it can be detected with sensitive telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few other methods that scientists use to find exoplanets, but these are the most common. As technology improves, we’re likely to discover more and more exoplanets using a variety of methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, scientists have discovered over 5,000 exoplanets. And they’re finding more all the time. We’re learning that there are all sorts of exoplanets out there, from gas giants to rocky worlds that could potentially support life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search for exoplanets is one of the most exciting and inspiring quests in human history. And who knows what we might discover in the years to come? We might find Earth-like planets that could potentially support life. We might even find evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search for exoplanets is a search for our place in the universe. It’s a search for our destiny.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">How do astronomers find exoplanets?

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to visit WASP-39 b a gas giant planet that orbits a Sun-like star 700 light-years away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASP-39 b is a hot and puffy planet with a mass roughly one-quarter that of Jupiter and a diameter 1.3 times greater than Jupiter. Its extreme puffiness is related in part to its high temperature of about 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit or 900 degrees Celsius. Unlike the cooler, more compact gas giants in our solar system, WASP-39 b orbits very close to its star – only about one-eighth the distance between the Sun and Mercury – completing one circuit in just over four Earth-days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is so close to its host star, it is likely to be tidally locked, which means one side of the planet faces the star at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASP-39 b was discovered in 2011 based on ground-based detections of the subtle, periodic dimming of light from its host star as the planet transits, or passes in front of the star. Since then, it has been studied by various telescopes, including NASA’s Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, which revealed the presence of water vapor, sodium, and potassium in the planet’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most exciting discovery came in July 2022, when WASP-39 b became the first exoplanet to be studied by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. The Webb Space Telescope captured the first clear evidence for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet outside the solar system. This observation provides important insights into the composition and formation of the planet. In November 2022, five science papers reported on WASP-39 b discoveries made using JWST. Those included the first observation of sulfur dioxide and photochemistry (chemical changes influenced by starlight) in an exoplanet atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASP-39 b is a fascinating example of how diverse and complex exoplanets can be. By studying its atmosphere with Webb, we can learn more about how this planet formed and evolved, and how it compares to other gas giants in our galaxy. WASP-39 b is also a promising target for future observations with Webb, which may be able to detect and measure carbon dioxide in the thinner atmospheres of smaller rocky planets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">WASP-39 b is a fascinating example of how diverse and complex exoplanets can be.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TRAPPIST-1: A System Full of Hope</title><link href="https://exoplanetradio.com/exoplanets/trappist1-a-system-full-of-hope/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TRAPPIST-1: A System Full of Hope" /><published>2023-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://exoplanetradio.com/exoplanets/trappist1-a-system-full-of-hope</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://exoplanetradio.com/exoplanets/trappist1-a-system-full-of-hope/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from our own solar system, one of the most studied stellar systems lies about 40 light-years away in the direction of the constellation Aquarius. Using ground and space based telescopes like Spitzer, Kepler, Hubble, and, now, the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers are looking hard at the seven rocky exoplanets orbiting the TRAPPIST-1 star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TRAPPIST-1 system, named after the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) in Chile, is currently the darling of both the astronomical community and the science-interested public. Discovered in 2016 by a team of astronomers in Belgium, this captivating system captured the attention of many because of its uncanny resemblance to our own solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TRAPPIST-1 system features a host star dramatically cooler and smaller than our Sun, classified as an ultra-cool dwarf. Its surrounding cohort consists of seven known planets. The planets are all named after letters of the alphabet, starting with b, the innermost planet, and ending with h, the outermost planet. The planets are so close together that they could all fit inside the orbit of Mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, NASA announced the discovery that this system had the most Earth-sized planets found in the habitable zone of a single star. This system of seven rocky worlds–all of them with the potential for water on their surface – is an exciting discovery in the search for life on other worlds. There is the possibility that future study of this unique planetary system could reveal conditions suitable for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit later, a closer study of the seven planets suggested that some could harbor far more water than the oceans of Earth, in the form of atmospheric water vapor for the planets closest to their star, liquid water for others, and ice for those farthest away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form that water would take on TRAPPIST-1 planets would depend on the amount of heat they receive from their star, which is a mere 9 percent as massive as our Sun. Planets closest to the star are more likely to host water in the form of atmospheric vapor, while those farther away may have water frozen on their surfaces as ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers say we now know more about the TRAPPIST-1 system of planets than any other planetary system apart from our own.  The excitement and hope that we may find life here is growing with every new observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While data from Hubble and Webb Space Telescopes have yet to confirm the existence of any atmospheres on any of these worlds, we have only just begun looking and hope abides with each new glance at this incredible system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">While data from Hubble and Webb Space Telescopes have yet to confirm the existence of any atmospheres on any of these worlds, we have only just begun looking and hope abides with each new glance at this incredible system</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Exoplanet Detected in Another Galaxy?</title><link href="https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/exoplanet-detected-another-galaxy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exoplanet Detected in Another Galaxy?" /><published>2023-08-01T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/exoplanet-detected-another-galaxy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/exoplanet-detected-another-galaxy/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have found evidence of a possible planet outside of our Milky Way galaxy. If confirmed, this is the first time that a planet has been detected in another galaxy. It is located in the spiral galaxy Messier 51, also called the Whirlpool Galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exoplanets are defined as planets outside of our Solar System. Until now, astronomers have found all other known exoplanets and exoplanet candidates in the Milky Way galaxy, almost all of them less than about 3,000 light-years from Earth. An exoplanet in M51 would be about 28 million light-years away, meaning it would be thousands of times farther away than those in the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These observations were made using NASA’s Chandra X-Ray Space Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers estimate the planet is about the size of Saturn and orbits a neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance of Saturn from the Sun. The planet was discovered when dips in the brightness of X-rays were observed from the binary system M51-ULS-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating because it’s the first time X-rays have been used to detect exoplanet transits and offers exciting possibilities for detecting these worlds that are outside of our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are not totally sure if the dimming seen here was caused by a planet, it could have been a passing cloud of gas and dust. However, they believe that the dimming is more likely caused by a planet because the characteristics of the event are not consistent with the passage of a cloud of gas and dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the region producing bright X-rays is so small, a planet passing in front of it could block most or all of the X-rays, making x-ray transits easier to spot because the X-rays can completely disappear, they would simply “blink out” as the planet passes by. This allows exoplanets to be detected at much greater distances than current optical light transits, which must be able to detect tiny decreases in light because the nearby planets only block a tiny fraction of the star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the dimming was caused by a planet, it would be the first planet ever discovered outside of the Milky Way galaxy. However, more data is needed to confirm the discovery. Because of the calculated orbit of the object, we will need to wait about 70 years for it to cross in front of its binary partner again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This possible planet is exciting because it opens up a new way to search for exoplanets. In the past, astronomers have only been able to find exoplanets in our own galaxy. However, by looking for X-ray transits in other galaxies, astronomers can now search for exoplanets much farther away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are hopeful that they will be able to find more exoplanet candidates in other galaxies. They are also planning to search for X-ray transits in Milky Way X-ray sources to discover new nearby planets in unusual environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discovery is a major step forward in the search for exoplanets. It shows that there are likely many planets out there in other galaxies, and it opens up a new way to find them&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">Astronomers have found evidence of a possible planet outside of our Milky Way galaxy</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The First Exoplanet of JWST</title><link href="https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/the-first-exoplanet-of-jwst/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The First Exoplanet of JWST" /><published>2023-07-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/the-first-exoplanet-of-jwst</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://exoplanetradio.com/discoveries/the-first-exoplanet-of-jwst/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have long wondered if we are alone in the cosmos. If there are other worlds like ours, where life might flourish. Now, a new eye in the sky has given us a glimpse of one such world. The James Webb Space Telescope has detected its first exoplanet. Its name is LHS 475b, and astronomers believe it is remarkably similar to our own home planet. It is roughly the same size as Earth, only slightly smaller by a mere 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did JWST find this distant world?  As LHS 475b orbits its star, it sometimes passes in front of it, blocking some of its light. By analyzing the spectrum of that light, and measuring the decrease in brightness of the star as the planet moves in front, we can see the size and infer the density of the planet, and even infer something about its atmosphere if it has one - astronomers aren’t sure yet about that. This is the first exoplanet confirmed by this massive space telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what kind of world is LHS 475b? Is it a place where life could exist? We do not know for sure yet, but we can make some educated guesses. All we know right now are its size, distance from its star, its density and some details of its spectrum, but we can glean a few things from this small amount of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of its size, we know that it is a rocky world, not a gas giant. We know that it is very close to its star, much closer than Mercury is to our Sun. This means that it is very hot, perhaps too hot for liquid water to exist on its surface. If it has an atmosphere, the spectrum tells us it is unlikely to be rich in methane, like Titan’s. It may be more like Venus, with a thick blanket of carbon dioxide and clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LHS 475b orbits a red dwarf star, one of the most common types of stars in the galaxy. It is located 41 light years away from us, in the southern constellation of Octans. It is a faint star and much cooler than our Sun. But even so, it provides enough energy for its planet to shine in the infrared spectrum. And that is how the Webb Space Telescope saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of our exploration of LHS 475b. We hope to learn more about its atmosphere, its climate, and its potential for life. We hope to find out if it is truly an Earth-like world, or if it is something else entirely. We hope to answer one of the oldest questions of humanity: are we alone? Or are there others out there, waiting for us to discover them?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">This is the First Exoplanet Confirmed by JWST</summary></entry></feed>
