&lt;p&gt;We live in a golden age of exoplanet discovery.  Not only are we searching for and finding new worlds around other stars all the time, but as our technology improves we are learning more about these exotic places and inexorably bearing down on the all important answer to the question of whether life elsewhere exists in our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next big milestone in our study of exoplanets is  a telescope that can see beyond the limits of our eyes, beyond the boundaries of our solar system, beyond the frontiers of our knowledge. A telescope that can reveal the secrets of the stars and the mysteries of the planets. A telescope that can take us closer to finding another home in the cosmos. That telescope is the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, a NASA observatory that is scheduled to launch in May 2027 and explore a wide range of astronomical phenomena, including exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing planets around other stars is a difficult business, one that pushes the boundaries of our technology.   Studying dim, small and elusive worlds to discover their potential for habitability requires novel techniques and state of the art telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the observations we need, the Roman Space Telescope will employ three techniques to study exoplanets: microlensing, direct imaging, and transit method. Each of these methods has its own advantages and limitations, and together they will provide a comprehensive view of the formation, evolution, and physical properties of planetary systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microlensing looks for a tiny flash of light from a background star as a planet moves between us  and the background star.  This flash is a signal that betrays the existence of a relatively small, dark world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transit method looks for tiny dips in brightness as a planet blocks out part of the star’s light.  These dimmings tell us a lot about the size of the planet, its orbit around the star and the length of its year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct imaging is the holy grail, the new thing humanity can do. Planets are billions of times dimmer than their host stars, they are so bright we can’t see the planet directly unless we block it.  To solve this problem, astronomers and engineers have been working on ways to take a direct look at small, Earth-sized worlds that lie hidden behind the glare of their star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Roman Space Telescope will demonstrate direct imaging technology that has never been flown aboard a space-based observatory before. Using this technology, Roman will help pave the way for future missions to image Earth-like planets around nearby stars and measure their spectra to search for signs of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using these complementary approaches, Roman will provide the most complete picture yet of the diversity and complexity of exoplanets. Roman will also take us another step closer to discovering another “pale blue dot” — a habitable, Earth-like planet orbiting a nearby star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just science fiction. This is science fact. This is what Roman will do for us. This is why Roman matters. This is how Roman will help advance knowledge about exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">The next big milestone in our study of exoplanets is a telescope that can see beyond the limits of our eyes, beyond the boundaries of our solar system, beyond the frontiers of our knowledge.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of astronomers used the James Webb Space Telescope to study the exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 c, which is one of seven rocky planets orbiting an ultracool red dwarf star 40 light-years from Earth. The team found that the planet’s atmosphere, if it exists at all, is extremely thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1 c is about the same size as Venus and receives a similar amount of radiation from its host star as Venus gets from the Sun. This led scientists to believe that the planet might have a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere like Venus. However, the Webb observations suggest that this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team used the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the Webb space telescope to observe TRAPPIST-1 c as it moved behind its star.   Webb can detect the heat that comes from the planet when it passes behind the star, which is called a secondary eclipse. By comparing the brightness of the star when the planet was behind it to the brightness when the planet was in front of it, the team was able to measure the amount of heat energy coming from the planet’s dayside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of heat energy emitted by a planet is directly related to its temperature, which in turn is influenced by its atmosphere. Carbon dioxide gas preferentially absorbs heat energy at the wavelengths that MIRI is sensitive to, so if TRAPPIST-1 c had a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, the team would have seen a smaller decrease in brightness when the planet moved behind its star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the team did not see a significant decrease in brightness, which suggests that the planet’s atmosphere, if it exists at all, is very thin. The team estimates that the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 c is at least 100 times thinner than Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a thick atmosphere around TRAPPIST-1 c suggests that the planet may have formed with relatively little water. This is because water vapor is a major component of thick atmospheres, and if TRAPPIST-1 c had a lot of water vapor, it would have been easier for the planet to retain a thick atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of a thick atmosphere also makes it less likely that TRAPPIST-1 c is habitable. Habitable planets are thought to need thick atmospheres to protect them from harmful radiation and to help regulate their temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is not lost however with regard to the TRAPPIST-1 system.  This planet is after all, very close to the star and just outside the region where liquid water could exist on the surface.  The observations of TRAPPIST-1c support the idea that planets close to their star have trouble holding on to an atmosphere, but that may not be the case with planets further out and actually inside the habitable zone, notably the planets TRAPPIST-1 e,f and g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study are a significant step forward in our understanding of exoplanets. The Webb space telescope is still in its early stages of operation, and scientists are excited to see what other discoveries it will make in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">TRAPPIST-1 c may not have a thick atmosphere, or any atmosphere at all, but all is not lost on the habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 system</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/exoplanets/TRAPPIST-1c_Artist.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/exoplanets/TRAPPIST-1c_Artist.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Trillions of Worlds Without Stars</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/discoveries/trillions-of-worlds-without-stars/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trillions of Worlds Without Stars" /><published>2023-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/discoveries/trillions-of-worlds-without-stars</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/discoveries/trillions-of-worlds-without-stars/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers estimate that there are more free roaming planets in our galaxy than there are planets in orbit around stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, rogue exoplanets - planets with no star whatsoever - far outnumber all other planets in our galaxy, by 20 times.  Trillions of worlds wandering alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers have reached this conclusion based on the results of a nine year survey that looked at special events that occur when an object such as a star or planet comes into near-perfect alignment with an unrelated background star from our vantage point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because anything with mass warps the fabric of space-time, light from the distant star bends around the nearer object as it passes close by. The nearer object acts as a natural lens, creating a brief spike in the brightness of the background star’s light that gives astronomers clues about the foreground object that they can’t see any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known as microlensing events, they are our primary method of observing free-floating planets in our galaxy.  Since they do not shine light on their own, planets are usually observed by looking at their reflected light of the star.  Even then, seeing exoplanets is hard.  We have to block out the light from the star to see anything at all, something we’ve only just been able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big way of seeing exoplanets is to infer their existence with dips in brightness from transits, or gravitational wobbling as stars were pulled around by their planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means that seeing exoplanets is a difficult business, but it’s not impossible.  Microlensing is one more technique in the arsenal of astronomers to detect these small, dark worlds.  We are using gravity to discover objects we would have no hope of seeing directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nine year survey recently completed by astronomers found one Earth-sized rogue planet and the second discovery of its kind.  The study also analyzed the survey data and concluded that rogue planets are more abundant than all other planets in our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Astronomers reason that rogue exoplanets tend to be smaller, Earth-sized or less.  Since they are small, they are more weakly tethered to their host star, and could be pulled away easier during gravitational encounters with other objects in the galaxy.   Another reason lies with the fact that planet building is a chaotic business that could easily see Earth-sized bodies thrown out of a nascent planetary system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding exoplanets in microlensing events is extraordinarily rare, the stars literally have to line up perfectly for us to be able to see them.  Each microlensing event is a one-time occurrence, meaning astronomers can’t go back and repeat the observations once they’re over.  So the best thing to do is look at large areas of the sky at once for a long time, to try and detect these small blips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to test these results, astronomers are looking forward to the launch of the wide-field Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope in May 2027.  Roman will be sensitive to even lower-mass rogue planets since it will observe from space, and it is estimated that it will find 400 rogue planets when it begins its survey of the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with ground-based telescopes these observations will help scientists measure the masses of rogue planets much more accurately than ever before, deepening our understanding of these dark nomads that grace our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">Astronomers estimate that there are more free roaming planets in our galaxy than there are planets in orbit around stars</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/IcyRogueWorld.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/IcyRogueWorld.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How Common are Habitable Exoplanets?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/science/how-common-habitable-exoplanets/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Common are Habitable Exoplanets?" /><published>2023-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/science/how-common-habitable-exoplanets</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/science/how-common-habitable-exoplanets/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big questions we are trying to answer in exoplanet astronomy is: Just how common are habitable planets?  We already know that exoplanets themselves are extremely common: Astronomers tell us there are on average 1.6 planets for every star in our galaxy, so there are more planets than stars out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That by itself is pretty amazing, but what we really want to know is, where’s the life?  How common are planets that could potentially support life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer so far has eluded us, and the news reports and studies coming out are a bit contradictory.  For example, as this recording is made, in July, 2023, over the course of just three days two studies were announced.  One is titled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Potentially Habitable Worlds are 100x times more common than We Thought” and a few day later: “Latest James Webb Space Telescope images hint that habitable planets are not common”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these headlines, it’s pretty clear that we are still sorting out how common habitability is, which is understandable because we’ve only just started studying exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are astronomers looking for and how are they doing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers are using every tool at their disposal to understand the habitability question of exoplanets.  Space Telescopes like Webb, Spitzer, Hubble, Kepler, TESS, and many others are setting their sites on finding and confirming exoplanets, arranging them by size and whether they exist in a habitable zone of their host star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground-based telescopes are measuring the wobble in the spectra of stars to determine planet masses and orbital periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real breakthrough will be measuring exoplanets directly and observing their disks when possible.  Right now, only the James Webb Space Telescope stands equipped to make those measurements.  Its mirror has the resolution necessary to see the exoplanets but more importantly it has a spectrograph that can measure the starlight as it travels through any atmosphere that might exist and give hints as to what it’s made of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main things JWST can show us with respect to the habitability of a given exoplanet are: whether it has an atmosphere, if it has one, what are some of the major chemical components of that atmosphere, including water, and crucially: are there any biosignatures in the atmosphere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biosignatures are those elements that are produced by life and accumulate in an atmosphere to detectable levels.  What are they?  Astronomers are taking the approach that since we know what compounds life on Earth produces, let’s look for those first.  What might the spectrum of Earth look like if it was transplanted to another, slightly different, Earth-like planet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like an oxygen-rich atmosphere, certain methane compounds, ammonia and carbon monoxide are good things to see for a start.  The trick for JWST will be getting enough orbits to make good measurements.  Since time is precious on JWST, this means that looking for planets that go around their stars quickly, and a primary candidate is the fascinating system of TRAPPIST-1.  Home to several worlds that could harbor life, are close to their star and orbit quicky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s not be too hard on astronomers this early in the search.  Right now our observations are preliminary and rough.  As they improve, our understanding of whether habitable planets are common or not will only get better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">How common are habitable exoplanets?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this episode, we are going to take a look at an extreme planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelt-9b is a gas giant planet that orbits a star 670 light-years from Earth. It is so close to its star that its dayside temperature is 7,800 degrees Fahrenheit (4,300 degrees Celsius), hotter than some stars. This heat is so intense that it rips apart the molecules in the planet’s atmosphere, including hydrogen gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its star, called KELT-9, is even hotter – a blue A-type star that is likely unraveling the planet through evaporation.  The KELT-9 is only 300 million years old, which is young for a star. It is more than twice as large, and nearly twice as hot, as our sun. Given that the planet’s atmosphere is constantly blasted with high levels of ultraviolet radiation, the planet may even be shedding a tail of evaporated planetary material like a comet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of Kelt-9b was announced in 2017 by a team of astronomers using the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) system. The KELT system is a network of two robotic telescopes that are used to search for exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelt-9b is a very massive planet, with a mass that is about three times that of Jupiter. The heat is caused by the proximity of the planet to its star. Kelt-9b orbits its star in just 36 hours, which means that it is constantly bathed in the star’s heat.  The planet is also unusual in that it orbits perpendicular to the spin axis of the star. That would be analogous to the planet orbiting perpendicular to the plane of our solar system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extreme heat of Kelt-9b has a profound effect on its atmosphere. The heat is so intense that it rips apart the molecules in the atmosphere, including hydrogen gas. This process is called photodissociation. The broken-up atoms then flow to the nightside of the planet, where it is cooler. On the nightside, the atoms can recombine to form molecules again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each orbit, KELT-9 b twice experiences the full range of stellar temperatures, producing what amounts to a peculiar seasonal sequence. The planet experiences “summer” when it swings over each hot pole and “winter” when it passes over the star’s cooler midsection. So KELT-9 b experiences two summers and two winters every orbit, with each season about nine hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is happening constantly on Kelt-9b, which means that the planet’s atmosphere is constantly being recycled. This makes it very difficult for any life to exist on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of Kelt-9b and other hot Jupiters is helping astronomers to better understand the formation and evolution of exoplanets. It is also helping them to learn more about the limits of habitability in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being the hottest exoplanet known, Kelt-9b is also one of the brightest. This makes it a valuable target for further study. Astronomers are using telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope to learn more about the atmosphere of Kelt-9b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of Kelt-9b is just one example of the exciting discoveries that are being made in the field of exoplanet research. As astronomers continue to study these distant worlds, they are learning more about the diversity of planets that exist beyond our solar system.

&lt;p&gt;Exoplanet astronomy is a new science, astronomers have only confirmed there are planets around other stars only 31 years ago with the discovery of two rocky planets orbiting a type of neutron star known as a pulsar in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been an amazing ride since then.  As of today, we’ve discovered over 5,000 extrasolar planets of all shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever humans start cataloging and classifying things, whether it be plants, animals, stars or exoplanets, we naturally become interested in the extrema: what is the smallest thing found, what’s the largest?  So, in the spirit of being human, let’s take a look at the largest exoplanet found so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the NASA exoplanet archive, HAT-P-67 b holds the distinction of being the largest exoplanet in terms of size.  With exoplanet classification, one always needs to be careful - especially when it comes to size and mass - because there is a fuzzy boundary with large planets where if they become too large, they are considered a brown dwarf star.  This is a body that almost made it to star status but doesn’t have enough mass or material for nuclear fusion to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HAT-P-67-b seems to fit the bill.  It is 1,200 light years from Earth and has a radius that is a little over twice that of Jupiters’.  It orbits its host star very closely, only 10 million kilometers away and has a year that is almost 5 days long.  The star itself,  HAT-P-67, is an F-type star that is one and a half times the mass of the Sun and about two and a half times larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planets like this are relatively easy to find using the transit method.  Large planets that eclipse their stars many times a month can be spotted using space telescopes like TESS because they are looking at an area of the sky for a limited amount of time and they can see many transits during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, it’s very hard to see a long period planet, one that takes many hundreds of days to transit its star.  A planet like Earth, for example, would only make one transit in 365 days to a distant observer so they would need to stare out at our Sun for a long time, especially if they wanted multiple transits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But HAT-P-67-b was easy to spot.  It was discovered in 2017 and since it transits so often confirmation was relatively quick.  Because of its low density, astronomers consider this planet a Hot-Saturn, with a mass about half that of Jupiters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as habitability goes, unless there are some moons orbiting this planet getting enough warmth to keep water liquid on its surface, there probably isn’t any life here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">HAT-P-67-b seems to fit the bill.

&lt;p&gt;The launch and deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope in July 2022, marked the beginning of a new era in exoplanet science.  Never before had humanity launched a more powerful and technologically advanced instrument into orbit that had the capabilities that JWST does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was designed to satisfy many science requirements, among them: to measure the properties of exoplanet atmospheres and even resolve their planetary disks.  As you can imagine, imaging exoplanets directly is not easy.  JWST does it by masking out the bright light of the host star using a one-of-a-kind coronagraph.  Coronagraphs are easy to visualize, they are just masks that block light from some part of the camera sensor.  Some solar telescopes for example use a little metal disk to block out the sun, but in true JWST style, the coronagraphs on Webb take things beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JWST has 248,000 microshutters that can open and close individually and when used in unison, create a mask that can cover the disk of a star.  There are five masks on the infrared camera and four on the infrared spectrograph.  When the light from the bright host star is blocked by these masks, the reflected light from the planet can be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how well does it work?  Has JWST imaged a planet yet?  Yep.  Sure has.  Just a few months after deployment, astronomers have used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to take a direct image of a planet outside our solar system. The exoplanet is a gas giant, meaning it has no rocky surface and could not be habitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a transformative moment, not only for Webb but also for exoplanet astronomy generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exoplanet in Webb’s image, called HIP 65426 b, is about six to 12 times the mass of Jupiter, and these observations could help narrow that down even further. It is young as planets go — about 15 to 20 million years old, compared to our 4.5-billion-year-old Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since HIP 65426 b is about 100 times farther from its host star than Earth is from the Sun, it is sufficiently distant that Webb can easily separate the planet from the star in the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking direct images of exoplanets is challenging because stars are so much brighter than planets. The HIP 65426 b planet is more than 10,000 times fainter than its host star in the near-infrared, and a few thousand times fainter than that in the mid-infrared. Obtaining this image is like digging for space treasure and finding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Webb Space Telescope managed to do it, just as designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s most exciting is that we’ve only just begun. There are many more images of exoplanets to come that will shape our overall understanding of their physics, chemistry, and planet formation. We may even discover previously unknown planets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">Just a few months after deployment, astronomers have used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to take a direct image of a planet outside our solar system.

&lt;p&gt;Tucked inside a quiet solar system, in the area of sky outlined by the constellation Aquarius, orbits a planet named TRAPPIST-1d, the third of seven planets in a system positioned 41 light years from our vantage point.  TRAPPIST-1d is a rocky, Earth-like planet, meaning that it is roughly the same size and mass as our home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1d has a radius that is about three quarters the size of Earth, and a comparable mass just a little heavier.  Planets like this are of intense interest to astronomers because they are so like our own.  In many respects, this planet is the most habitable exoplanet found so far.  It is not large enough to retain light gasses like hydrogen and helium, which could destroy nascent life and it is comfortably situated in the star’s habitable zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the TRAPPIST-1 planets are close to its star; the entire system can fit inside the orbit of Mercury.  All of these planets are racing around their home star and TRAPPIST-1d  has a year that is a mere 4 Earth days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, TRAPPIST-1d’s proximity to its host star, merely 2.2 million kilometers, would initially hint that it is a world bathed in lethal radiation.  Orbiting a red dwarf star can be dangerous for any life that might be trying to make it on the surface.  While these stars’ lifetimes are measured in the trillions of years - which is a good thing because it gives life a long time to evolve if its there - their early life is defined by huge stellar activity and raging eruptions that could bake anything living on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, later on, things settle down and due to being a relatively cool star compared to ours, the light and heat it receives becomes benign, only 4.3% of that which reaches our Earth from our more boisterous Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This serendipitous combination of distance, host star, and proportion places TRAPPIST-1d in an inintriguing position. At this point in the star’s life its light might heat its surface just enough to sustain liquid water.  But any life trying to make it there must overcome one more obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The close proximity ot TRAPPIST-1d may put the star in a state of tidal locking, this is a condition where the planet’s daily rotation matches its revolution around the star, placing one side always facing the star whilst the other is cloacked in darkness – a stark, perpetual contrast.  Astronomers believe that tidally locked planets may harbor life at the terminator zone of the surface, the line denominating constant darkness with continual heat and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this canvas of cosmic chaos and order, TRAPPIST-1d is a tantalizing world. It forces us to abandon our assumptions and welcome the plausibility of life’s existence in corners of the universe we previously dismissed as devoid or hostile.  We wait anxiously for more observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the apparent silence of the cosmos, TRAPPIST-1d resounds loudly in the ears of our curiosity, a cosmic chant luring us to explore beyond the confines of our own world. In the cosmic theater, 41 light years is a mere stride. As we gaze on these alien lands upon the cosmic horizon, the symphony of the stars resonates within us, a celestial music reminding us of both our insignificance and potential within this infinite cosmic orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">Tucked inside a quiet solar system, in the area of sky outlined by the constellation Aquarius, orbits a planet named TRAPPIST-1d, the third of seven planets in a system positioned 41 light years from our vantage point.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we’ve created Exoplanet Radio is that Exoplanets are awesome.  The idea that there are planets in orbit around stars outside our solar system - and even rogue planets that do not orbit a star meandering through interstellar space - is one that cannot help but capture our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, finding them is very hard.  They are small and dim compared to stars so we need to rely on indirect methods to see them like looking for dips in brightness or a wobbling star, or, in the case of rogue planets with no stars, tiny flashes of light from background stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ideally, we’d like to see them directly, in our telescopes.  Is that possible?  You probably guessed I wouldn’t have brought up the question if the answer wasn’t ‘yes’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, we have discovered over 5000 exoplanets, using transit, radial velocity and microlensing methods. But there is another way to find exoplanets that has only recently been possible: by directly seeing them with our eyes. This is unimaginatively called the direct imaging method, and has revealed some amazing results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the scenario: We see all planets - including those in our solar system - in reflected light from the star.  Starlight shines on a planet and is reflected to our telescopes.  Now imagine trying to see a tiny speck of dust next to a bright light bulb. That is the challenge of direct imaging  planets light years away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The star’s light is so dazzling that it blinds us from seeing the planet’s faint glow. To fix that, astronomers use a special device called a coronagraph, which blocks out the star’s light and lets us see the planet’s light. It is like putting a finger over the light bulb, so we can see the dust speck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this method, astronomers have captured some stunning images of exoplanets, such as 2M1207b, the first exoplanet to be directly imaged, and also the first one to orbit a brown dwarf star, a failed star that is too small to shine. We have also seen four planets orbit around the young star HR8799, in a mesmerizing choreography of motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct imaging is not only beautiful, but also powerful. It can tell us more about the exoplanets than any other method. It has the potential to show us their colors, shapes, sizes, and even their weather patterns. It can reveal their oceans, continents, and maybe even signs of life. It can open our eyes to new worlds and new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct imaging is still a young and evolving technique, but it has already shown us some of the most incredible sights in the universe. As our technology improves, we will be able to see more and more exoplanets with direct imaging, and learn more about them. We will be able to witness the diversity and beauty of these distant worlds, and maybe even find one that is like our own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">So here’s the scenario: We see all planets - including those in our solar system - in reflected light from the star.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a planet that is so far away from us that it takes 40 years for its light to reach us. Now imagine that this planet has not one, but two stars that it orbits around. And finally, imagine that this planet has clouds made of sand particles that change the brightness of its atmosphere wildly as they move in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This planet, VHS 1256 b, has recently been observed by the James Webb Space Telescope  and it is a very interesting world. It is not like any of the planets in our solar system, or even like most of the planets that we have found outside our solar system. It is a type of planet called a brown dwarf, which is somewhere between a giant gas planet and a small star. Brown dwarfs are very hard to study, because they are very faint and cold compared to stars, and very bright and hot compared to planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But VHS 1256 b is different from other brown dwarfs, because it has some features that make it easier to observe. First of all, it is very young, only 150 million years old, which is much younger than our sun, at 4.6 billion years old. This means that it is still hot and glowing from its formation, and has not cooled down yet, making it very bright in the infrared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is very far away from its two stars, about four times farther than Pluto is from our sun. This means that it does not get much light or heat from its host stars, and also that its light does not get mixed with the light from its stars when we look at it from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, it has a very fast rotation, spinning around once every 22 hours. This means that its atmosphere is constantly changing and moving, creating different patterns and colors on its surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features make VHS 1256 b a perfect target for the James Webb Space Telescope. JWST is the most powerful and advanced telescope ever built, and it can see things that no other telescope can see. It can see infrared light, which is invisible to our eyes, but which reveals a lot of information about the temperature, composition, and structure of objects in space. It can also see very faint and distant objects, like VHS 1256 b, with great clarity and detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Webb, scientists have been able to see some amazing things about VHS 1256 b’s atmosphere. They have found that it has clouds made of silicate dust, which are tiny particles of rocks like quartz or sand. These clouds are very high in the air, where the temperature is about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (830 degrees Celsius), which is way hotter than an oven. The clouds have different sizes of dust grains, some as small as smoke and some as large as sand. The size of the dust grains affects how they reflect and scatter light, creating different colors and brightness levels on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Webb has also been able to see what gasses are in VHS 1256 b’s air. It has found water, methane, carbon monoxide, and maybe carbon dioxide. This is the first time that so many gases are found on a brown dwarf or a planet outside our solar system. These gasses tell us about the chemistry and history of the planet, and how it formed and evolved over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VHS 1256 b is a fascinating example of how diverse and complex the universe is. It shows us that there are many types of planets out there that we have not seen before, and that we can learn a lot from them using new technologies like Webb. It also challenges us to think about what makes a planet a planet, and what makes life possible on a planet. VHS 1256 b may not be habitable for us or any other life forms that we know of, but it may have some secrets or surprises that we have not discovered yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="exoplanets" /><summary type="html">VHS 1256 b is a fascinating example of how diverse and complex the universe is.
