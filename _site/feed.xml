  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to explore a remarkable world that lies beyond our solar system: Kepler-22b. This planet is one of the first confirmed exoplanets in the habitable zone of its star, where liquid water could exist on its surface. But what is this world like? How far is it from us, and from its sun? And could it harbor life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kepler-22b orbits a star that is very similar to our own sun, but slightly smaller and cooler. The star is called Kepler-22, and it is located about 640 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. That means that the light we see from this star today left it when Europe was in the last throes of the Middle Ages. To travel there with our current technology would take millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planet itself is about twice the size of Earth, but its mass and composition are unknown. It could be a rocky world like ours, or a water world covered in a global ocean, or even a gas giant with no solid surface at all. The only way to find out for sure is to observe it more closely with future telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kepler-22b takes about 290 days to complete one orbit around its star, which is about the same as our year. Its distance from its star is a little less than the Earth is from the Sun. And it receives about the same amount of sunlight that Earth does, making this a promising place for life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a catch: Kepler-22b may not have a stable climate like Earth does.  Astronomers have noticed that this planet moves in a highly inclined orbit, roughly 90 degrees from the orbits of the other planets.  If it runs out to have a highly elliptical orbit as well, then this could create extreme temperature differences between day and night, and possibly strong winds and storms. However, if Kepler-22b has a thick atmosphere or a large moon, then it could have a more moderate rotation and seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of life on Kepler-22b is still open, there is so much we don’t know. If it has liquid water on its surface, it could be a potential harbor for living organisms. But water alone is not enough: life also needs energy, nutrients, and protection from harmful radiation. We do not know if Kepler-22b has any of these characteristics, or if it is compatible with our form of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kepler-22b is a fascinating example of the diversity and wonder of the cosmos. It challenges us to imagine what other worlds may exist out there, and what forms of life may inhabit them. It also reminds us of how precious and unique our own planet is, and how much we have to learn about it and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting recent discoveries in astronomy has been the existence of planets around other stars.  Called exoplanets, they vary wildly in their characteristics, appearance and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the over 5000 exoplanets discovered so far are in orbit around other stars, some whiz around their home sun in a matter of only days while others have orbits that last decades or hundred of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is another interesting class of exoplanets that do not have a home sun.  These rogue worlds travel the distance between the stars, they live in the cold, dark interstellar regions of the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free floating planets like this are very difficult to spot.  Since we have found most exoplanets by looking at them indirectly, like watching the star’s brightness dip as it passes in front or makes the star wobble as it pulls it in its orbit, there is not much to go on to find the roaming exoplanets around no star at all - we do not have the technology to image them directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, amazingly, astronomers have found some, over 70 exoplanets that do not have a host star have been found roaming the galaxy.  Using over 20 years worth of data from dozens of telescopes, astronomers have uncovered some of the dimmest objects in our Milky Way, and some of them are planets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most interesting of all, if any of these free floating planets happen to have a moon around it, and the exoplanet itself is large enough, like Jupiter say, astronomers surmise that the heat generated by the gravity of these systems might actually be enough to harbor life on the revolving moon. If we could find life on a world like that, it would be a strong argument that life in the universe is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="discoveries" /><summary type="html">Astronomers have detected many rogue planets</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What is an Exoplanet?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/science/what-is-an-exoplanet/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is an Exoplanet?" /><published>2023-07-21T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/science/what-is-an-exoplanet</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/science/what-is-an-exoplanet/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of human history, we had no idea if there were other worlds beyond our own. We gazed at the stars and wondered: are we alone in this vast and awesome cosmos? Or is there life out there, perhaps even intelligent life, with whom we could someday communicate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still do not know the answer to that question, but we have made some progress. We have explored our own solar system, a family of planets and other bodies that orbit our Sun. We have discovered eight major planets, some with moons of their own, and many smaller objects like asteroids and comets. We are even searching for a possible ninth planet, far beyond the orbit of Neptune. But these are all our neighbors, our kin. We share a common origin and a common destiny with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exoplanets are different. They are worlds that orbit other stars, far away from our Sun. They are strangers, unknown and mysterious. And they are very numerous. In the past few decades, we have detected over five thousand of them, using various methods and instruments. And we suspect there are many more, perhaps billions or even trillions in our galaxy alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exoplanets come in all shapes and sizes. Some are huge and hot, like Jupiter but much more so. They circle their stars so closely that they are scorched by their heat and radiation. Some are smaller and colder, like Neptune or Uranus. They may have thick atmospheres of gas and ice. And some are rocky and terrestrial, like Earth or Mars. They may have solid surfaces and perhaps even oceans and continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most intriguing exoplanets are those that resemble Earth in some way. They are not too big or too small, not too hot or too cold. They orbit their stars in a zone where liquid water could exist on their surface. Water is essential for life as we know it. And so we wonder: could these exoplanets harbor life? Could they be oases of green and blue in the desert of space? Could they be home to creatures that think and feel and dream?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not know yet. But we are trying to find out. We are building new telescopes and instruments that will allow us to study these exoplanets in more detail. We will look for signs of water, oxygen, methane and other molecules that could indicate the presence of life. We will listen for signals that could be sent by intelligent beings. We will try to make contact with our cosmic cousins, if they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are on the verge of a new era of discovery and exploration. We are about to learn more about our place in the universe and our connection to other worlds. We are about to answer one of the oldest and most profound questions of our species: are we the only ones?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tony Darnell</name><email>exoplanetradio@deepastronomy.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html">There are many types of planets around other stars</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Exoplanet Radio</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/exoplanets/welcome-to-exoplanet-radio/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Exoplanet Radio" /><published>2023-07-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-07-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/exoplanets/welcome-to-exoplanet-radio</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/exoplanets/welcome-to-exoplanet-radio/">&lt;div class=&quot;plyr&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to Exoplanet Radio, the podcast that takes you on a journey to the most fascinating worlds beyond our solar system. Every day, we bring you the latest news, discoveries, and stories about exoplanets, the planets that orbit other stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of these planets known to us, and many more waiting to be found. They come in all shapes and sizes, from giant gas balls to rocky Earth-like worlds. Some of them are scorching hot, some are freezing cold, and some are just right for liquid water and maybe even life. We explore their diversity, their mysteries, and their potential for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also look at the science behind searching for these distant worlds, using powerful telescopes and clever techniques. We will explore how we find these planets, how we study their atmospheres, climates, and geology, and we try to answer the big questions: How did these planets form? How do they evolve? And are we alone in the universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you are an astronomy enthusiast, a science fiction fan, or just curious about the universe, this podcast is for you. No prior knowledge needed!
