Exoplanet 42 Draconis b, also known as Orbitar. This is a candidate extrasolar planet located approximately **315 light years** away from Earth in the constellation of Draco². It orbits the 5th magnitude K-type giant star 42 Draconis, also known as Fafnir², with a period of **479 days** and **38%** orbital eccentricity¹².

But what is an exoplanet? An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star other than our Sun. Exoplanets come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and compositions. Some are similar to Earth, while others are very different. Some may even have the potential to support life.

To compare 42 Draconis b with Earth, let's look at some of their properties in this table:

| Property | 42 Draconis b | Earth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planet type | Gas giant | Terrestrial |
| Mass | 3.88 Jupiters¹ | 1 Earth |
| Radius | 1.16 Jupiters (estimate) ¹ | 1 Earth |
| Orbital radius | 1.19 AU¹ | 1 AU |
| Orbital period | 479.1 days¹ | 365.25 days |
| Habitability | Unlikely | Yes |

As you can see, 42 Draconis b is much larger and more massive than Earth. It is also farther away from its star and has a longer orbital period. It has a highly elliptical orbit that brings it closer and farther from its star than Earth does from the Sun. It is unlikely to be habitable because it is a gas giant, meaning it has no solid surface and probably no atmosphere suitable for life.

The discovery of 42 Draconis b was announced in 2008 by a team of astronomers using the radial velocity method¹. This method measures the tiny wobbles of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The more massive the planet, the bigger the wobble.

However, a recent study in 2021 found that more recent radial velocity measurements of 42 Draconis were inconsistent with the proposed planetary orbit, casting serious doubt on 42 Draconis b's existence². The study suggests that the radial velocity signal is likely caused by a yet unknown stellar phenomenon, which might be common in giant stars².

So, is 42 Draconis b real or not? The answer is still unclear. More observations and analysis are needed to confirm or refute its existence. Until then, it remains a fascinating candidate exoplanet that challenges our understanding of planetary formation and evolution.
